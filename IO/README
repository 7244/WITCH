some backends have `IO_set_fd_limit` thats because syscall/posix is not portable enough to handle different types of fds.
so we are kinda emulating IO_* functions based on type of fd.

as example;
in linux you can call write() for every fd. doesnt matter type of fd socket or file etc.
but in windows you need to call send() instead of write(). this breaks portability of function.
so for windows backend IO_write checks type of fd then calls right function write() or send().

and this is not related about how windows sucks even other unix kernels does same thing for spectific functions.
freebsd has completely different sendfile() and dstfd only able to be socket.
